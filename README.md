# Welcome to Learn Lua!
Learn Lua is an evolving project that began in 2021 with the mission of helping individuals master Roblox Lua, also known as LuaU. Our journey has seen us transition from a Wix website to a custom-built React site, and now to our current home on GitHub.

## Contribute and Collaborate ü§ù
We invite LuaU experts and enthusiasts to engage with our project. If you have ideas for new features, improvements, or corrections, your contributions are highly valued. Together, we can make Learn Lua an even more powerful tool for learning and mastering LuaU.
